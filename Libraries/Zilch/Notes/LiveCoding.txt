Container ranges / array binding
Handle as a handle object - outline all cases
Binding (less macros, no Internal External stuff, except maybe in type declaration)
Property (Get/Set) binding

experiment with hot loading

untyped block array needs to properly copy construct

right now, function modifications work (still need to copy variables over)

We do a first pass through patching direct functions

OLD:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)
NEW:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)

Then for any functions that didn't map back, we do another pass looking for raw compatible overloads (and implicitly convertable to)

All passes on this level must ALSO add the new function in to the library

OLD:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)
NEW:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : Event)

FAILS (AND IT SHOULD):
OLD:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : Event)
NEW:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)

Finally, we do a pass looking for functions that could be compatible but require code generation
 - but we should allow down-casting... I think

OLD:  function OnLogicUpdate(event : Event)
      {
        // Ideally:
        var p0 = event as UpdateEvent;
        if (p0 == null)
        {
          return; // Log it here?
        }
        this.[NEW]OnLogicUpdate(p0);
      }
      
NEW:  function ComputeStuff(a : Real, b : Integer)
OLD:  function ComputeStuff(a : Real, b : Real, c : String)

if the function was virtual, do we want to reassign it to a base class function (if non pure) instead of just wiping it?
 - maybe make it call the base version...

All new functions need to be added to the library (we're basically merging the library with the other one)
 - We don't need to modify the library that's newly compiled, just the old one (and the old one needs to now store a 'patch' reference

We also need to merge types

lastly, we want to make some sort of special code you can do for patching that, when code is added, we will run it
 - ideally new lines of code (or changed lines of code)
 - adding new connect statements to Initialize
 - how do we disconnect? just remove the function :P
